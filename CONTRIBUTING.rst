  you are welcome to write an issue describing the problem.

Make changes (create pull requests)
===================================

You cannot make changes to the documentation in this repository directly. This ViewHelper
reference is automatically generated from comments in the ViewHelper code source files (PHP).

So, in order to make changes, you will need to make the changes in the repository where the
source code is kept using the contribution workflow for that repository. And you will need
to edit the comments in the PHP comments using a basic reST syntax.

Currently, the ViewHelper reference retrieves code from 2 sources. Check the path of the
URL of the rendered version or look in this repository for the path of the files you wish
to change:
